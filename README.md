This is what happened to me after watching Networkchuck's video about making Elden Ring in bash. I am very new to this so don't expect too much of it.

I made this to try and learn bash and because it is very, very fun to do. The first (and the only) file on here, is the first version. In this version there are 3 classes but I have only written the script for the Swordsman.
In future versions I would like to have the other options avaliable as well as having a working second (forest) level.
